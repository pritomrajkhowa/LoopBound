Unlike Hoare's logic, our approach does not rely on loop invariants. Unlike the typical temporal logic specification of a program, our translation does not require a transition system model of the program, and is compositional on the structures of the program. Some non-trivial examples are given to show the effectiveness of our translation for proving properties of programs. },

Our method, based on Farkas' Lemma, synthesizes linear invariants by extracting non-linear constraints on the coefficients of a target invariant from a program. These constraints guarantee that the linear invariant is inductive. We then apply existing techniques, including specialized quantifier elimination methods over the reals, to solve these non-linear constraints. Our method has the advantage of being complete for inductive invariants. To our knowledge, this is the first sound and complete technique for generating inductive invariants of this form. We illustrate the practicality of our method on several examples, including cases in which traditional methods based on abstract interpretation with widening fail to generate sufficiently strong invariants.",

The verification condition of the program is then encoded by means of a boolean formula over these boolean indicator variables such that any satisfying assignment to the formula yields the inductive invariants for proving the validity of given program assertions.",

	abstract="In this paper, we present SeaHorn, a software verification framework. The key distinguishing feature of SeaHorn is its modular design that separates the concerns of the syntax of the programming language, its operational semantics, and the verification semantics. SeaHorn encompasses several novelties: it (a)Â encodes verification conditions using an efficient yet precise inter-procedural technique, (b)Â provides flexibility in the verification semantics to allow different levels of precision, (c)Â leverages the state-of-the-art in software model checking and abstract interpretation for verification, and (d)Â uses Horn-clauses as an intermediate language to represent verification conditions which simplifies interfacing with multiple verification tools based on Horn-clauses. SeaHorn provides users with a powerful verification tool and researchers with an extensible and customizable framework for experimenting with new software verification techniques. The effectiveness and scalability of SeaHorn are demonstrated by an extensive experimental evaluation using benchmarks from SV-COMP 2015 and real avionics code.",

	abstract="Formally verifying properties of programs that manipulate arrays in loops is computationally challenging. In this paper, we focus on a useful class of such programs, and present a novel property-driven verification method that first infers array access patterns in loops using simple heuristics, and then uses this information to compositionally prove universally quantified assertions about arrays. Specifically, we identify tiles of array access patterns in a loop, and use the tiling information to reduce the problem of checking a quantified assertion at the end of a loop to an inductive argument that checks only a slice of the assertion for a single iteration of the loop body. We show that this method can be extended to programs with sequentially composed loops and nested loops as well. We have implemented our method in a tool called                                                                           {\$}{\$}{\backslash}textsc {\{}Tiler{\}}{\$}{\$}                .

In this paper, we describe an efficient algorithm for computing the transitive closures of difference bounds, octagonal and finite monoid affine relations. On the theoretical side, this framework provides a common solution to the acceleration problem, for all these three classes of relations. In practice, according to our experiments, the new method performs up to four orders of magnitude better than the previous ones, making it a promising approach for the verification of integer programs.",

	abstract="This paper attempts to provide an adequate basis for formal definitions of the meanings of programs in appropriately defined programming languages, in such a way that a rigorous standard is established for proofs about computer programs, including proofs of correctness, equivalence, and termination. The basis of our approach is the notion of an interpretation of a program: that is, an association of a proposition with each connection in the flow of control through a program, where the proposition is asserted to hold whenever that connection is taken. To prevent an interpretation from being chosen arbitrarily, a condition is imposed on each command of the program. This condition guarantees that whenever a command is reached by way of a connection whose associated proposition is then true, it will be left (if at all) by a connection whose associated proposition will be true at that time. Then by induction on the number of commands executed, one sees that if a program is entered by a connection whose associated proposition is then true, it will be left (if at all) by a connection whose associated proposition will be true at that time. By this means, we may prove certain properties of programs, particularly properties of the form: `If the initial values of the program variables satisfy the relation Rl, the final values on completion will satisfy the relation R2'.",
