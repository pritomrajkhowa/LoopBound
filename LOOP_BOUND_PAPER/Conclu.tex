\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclu}
We have presented an automatic tool for computing closed form solution of recurrences. We have integrated this to our previously developed automated program verifier \SystemName\ . The interaction extended the capability of the tools. We have demonstrated that by proving the correctness of challenging programs
from the benchmark of existing state-of-the-art tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that can find the closed form solution of conditional recurrence function. In the future, we plan to extend recSolve(RS) to handle a wide range of conditional recurrence, mutual recurrence, and conditional mutual recurrence functions. We attempted to apply it to more applications such as analysis of the worst-case execution time, automatic generation of the unit test case and automatic program repair. For future work, we want to extend our systems, \SystemName\ with a more powerful tactic for wide classes of programs, and for proving properties regarding termination.
